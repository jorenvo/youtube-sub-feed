* youtube-sub-feed
A simple Python 3 script that reads YouTube channel names from a
specified file and creates a subscription feed in HTML without the
need for a YouTube account.
** Requirements
- Python 3
- [[http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/][Beautiful Soup 4]]
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
youtube_sub_feed.py channels-file [output-file]
#+END_SRC
*** channels-file
The channels-file argument is required and should be a
newline-separated plain text file containing YouTube channel
names.
*** output-file
A path specifying the name of the HTML file. If this is omitted the
HTML file is written to stdout. The HTML file will contain valid HTML5
and will consist of the three most recent videos of each specified
channel reverse sorted by their published date (so that the most
recent video appears on top). It will also display a thumbnail image
for the /eight most recent videos/. This is done to save some bandwith
when dealing with a large amount of channels. Lastly, the channel
names in the HTML file are hyperlinks to the /videos page/, not the
home page, of each channel.
** Notes
The YouTube API v2.0 does not support getting videos for multiple
channels in one request. Because of this a separate request needs to
be done for each channel. To speed the script up a bit eight worker
threads are used for the channels. This way eight channels can be
handled simultaneously. Creating more than eight threads does not
speed it up further because YouTube currently limits the amount of
open connections per client to eight.
** Example
Given the following channels-file:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacsrocks
minutephysics
minuteearth
smalin
#+END_SRC
The produced HTML file looks like this:
